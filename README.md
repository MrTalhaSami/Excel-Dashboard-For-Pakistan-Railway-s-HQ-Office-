# Excel Dashboard For Pakistan Railway's HQ Office
Created an Excel dashboard for Pakistan Railways HQ to analyze employee data (BS-1 to BS-16), including gender ratio, qualifications, workforce distribution, age groups, and employment categories. Used pivot tables and interactive visualizations like pie, bar, and donut charts for dynamic insights.
